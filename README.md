# CLI C# Bag â€“ University Project (1st Semester)

This is a simple command-line project written in C# that implements a **Bag** (multiset) data structure. The Bag holds integers and supports key operations such as inserting, removing, checking frequency, and identifying the largest element. All data is stored as a list of `(element, frequency)` tuples.

The project includes comprehensive unit tests and was developed as part of a university OOP programming course to demonstrate basic object-oriented principles and testing skills.

## ðŸ§© Features

- Insert and remove elements
- Track element frequency
- Get the largest element efficiently
- Print bag contents
- Throw appropriate exceptions for edge cases
- Fully tested using custom test cases

## ðŸ“š University Context

This project was completed in the **first semester** as part of the Object-Oriented Programming curriculum.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- `Bag.cs` â€“ Core class implementing the Bag logic
- `Program.cs` â€“ Entry point with CLI interface
- `BagTests.cs` â€“ Unit tests for all core functionalities
- `Exceptions.cs` â€“ Custom exceptions for Bag operations

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
dotnet run
